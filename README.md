# SIH-Annadata

Background
India faces a growing challenge in ensuring food security while improving agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. Low productivity is often caused by traditional farming practices, inadequate access to real-time data, poor irrigation management, lack of precision in use of pesticide and/or fertilizer and delayed identification of pests and diseases. Most farmers operate on instinct and experience rather than data-driven decisions. Introducing technology that can offer customized advisory based on crop, soil and climatic conditions can significantly boost productivity and lead to use of resource efficiency, leading to better yields and higher profitability.

Problem description
The task is to develop a smart, data-driven advisory system that provides personalized recommendations to farmers to improve their crop productivity. This could include suggestions on optimal sowing times, irrigation scheduling, pest and disease management, fertilizer use and climate-resilient practices. The platform should be capable of gathering data from sensors (IoT), satellite imagery, weather APIs and farmer inputs. It should process the data using analytics or AI/ML techniques and present actionable guidance in a simple manner. Participants can also explore integration with Soil Health Cards data, AgriStack data, Krishi DSS data or local agricultural research station databases. The challenge lies in making the solution accessible, understandable, scalable and useful for farmers with limited digital literacy.

Expected solution
A prototype of a smart advisory platform (mobile app/web portal/IoT-based) that delivers timely, localized and personalized advice to farmers. It should include mechanisms for collecting field data, analysing it intelligently and delivering suggestions in local languages. Visual indicators, voice prompts or AI-powered virtual assistants can be used for ease of communication. The system must be scalable, cost-effective, energy-efficient and adaptable to different agro-climatic regions and crops. Participants are also encouraged to leverage anonymized sample data from AgriStack, India's comprehensive digital platform for the agriculture sector, to enhance the accuracy and relevance of their advisory solutions while ensuring secure and consent-based data usage. Bonus points for incorporating sustainability elements like water conservation, organic practices, or carbon footprint tracking.
